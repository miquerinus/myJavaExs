<h1>Small repository of JAVA exercises</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

    To store small snippets of code written by me in the JAVA language.

<h2>Details</h2>

    - Most of the codes written in java by me were using the SWINGX library, Why? To create a more intuitive experience with the user (in my case).

    - Codes seem quite verbose but this is due to the nature of the language, but there is also the fact that I am still a student in the process of improving my programming logic, I still can't be so concise in writing the codes, making the codes a little more verbose.

    - As a tool I used VScode with extensions available provided by Red Hat.

    - All codes are written in a Linux environment, specifically the Arch distro to date.
